# Lost-Votes Tech Solution Challenge
Many Indians are always on the move for work or education. Many things like the bank accounts and mobile numbers automatically travel with us. But our right to votes is tied to the place where it’s registered in. An individual must be physically present where they are registered on polling day to be allowed to vote. Because of this a lot of individuals are not able to vote and this results in declining the voting percentage. It needs to be changed. It should be possible for every Indian to vote irrespective of where he or she may be temporarily located. This is an application, to change their polling station. So that, the voters can vote according to their near-by polling station in the day of voting for their own constituency. Thus, the voter’s privacy, voter’s unique identification, anonymity can also be protected and maintained.
